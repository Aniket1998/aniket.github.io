# Hello World!

I'm a Sophomore Undergrad in the [Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in/ee/) fascinated by artificial intelligence. My academic interests currently lie in __deep learning__ applied to __computer vision__. I'm highly passionate about __unsupervised representation learning__ (particularly __disentangled representations__) and generative models, and spend quite a bit of my time tinkering with __Generative Adversarial Networks__ and __Variational Autoencoders__. I also maintain an interest in the theory of Probabilistic Machine Learning

I also love contributing to the open source deep learning community, reading and understanding research papers in the field that pique my interest, then attempting to reproduce and marignally improve the results in PyTorch and __Tensorflow__.
